          "fullDescription": "The current method calls an async method that returns a Task or a Task<TResult> and doesn't apply the await operator to the result. The call to the async method starts an asynchronous task. However, because no await operator is applied, the program continues without waiting for the task to complete. In most cases, that behavior isn't what you expect. Usually other aspects of the calling method depend on the results of the call or, minimally, the called method is expected to complete before you return from the method that contains the call.\u000a\u000aAn equally important issue is what happens to exceptions that are raised in the called async method. An exception that's raised in a method that returns a Task or Task<TResult> is stored in the returned task. If you don't await the task or explicitly check for exceptions, the exception is lost. If you await the task, its exception is rethrown.\u000a\u000aAs a best practice, you should always await the call.\u000a\u000aYou should consider suppressing the warning only if you're sure that you don't want to wait for the asynchronous call to complete and that the called method won't raise any exceptions. In that case, you can suppress the warning by assigning the task result of the call to a variable.",
